Higher resolution, SVG and drawio versions are available in the "Current-Version" directory. If you want to make a customized version of the diagram, load the .drawio file into https://app.diagrams.net/.

If you think you've spotted a flaw in the logic of this flowchart or if you have any other suggestions, please create a new issue.

Moderator decisions take priority over any advice given by this flow chart. This chart does not cover all edge cases. More edge cases, rules and examples can be found on the [wiki](https://wiki.sponsor.ajay.app/index.php/Main_Page). If you need more information, message the moderators on discord.

Thanks to Deedit, Daehock, Doomdrvk and blabdude for design suggestions and review.
